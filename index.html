            <h2>About Coalition</h2>
            <p>Coalition is an open code project that allows front-end developers to share modules in their apps immediately, leveraging webpack module federation. The project's goal is to create an experience similar to Docker, but for front-end developers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Allow developers to dynamically run code from multiple different sources in a single web application.</li>
                <li>Enable the sharing of dependencies between different applications, reducing the overall load and initialization time.</li>
                <li>Allow for the isolation of code, meaning that different parts of an application (or different applications altogether) can use different versions of the same dependency without conflict.</li>
                <li>Supports both synchronous and asynchronous loading of remote modules, providing flexibility in how applications are structured and loaded.</li>
                <li>Facilitate of micro-frontends. Different teams can work on different parts of an application independently, and integrate their parts into a larger application.</li>
                <li>Hot Update remote modules. Update with new features or fixes without requiring a full redeployment of the entire application.</li>
            </ul>
